## Overview

### The challenge

As part of the hiring process, the goal was to showcase proficiency in building a responsive GitHub user search application with specific requirements:

- Use functional components with hooks
- Ensure the app is responsive
- Utilize ES6 syntax, including arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc.
- Display a spinner (or similar) when information is fetching
- Incorporate a UI component library such as Material-UI (MUI) or Chakra UI
- Handle errors coming from the backend gracefully
- Add React Context if relevant, e.g., switching between light/dark mode
- Maintain a clean git history with meaningful commit messages
- Showcase common tools used in the daily development environment, including linters and code formatters
- Use types with TypeScript for improved code clarity and reliability
